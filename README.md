* Select a folder, note that the resizer will resize all images in the folder and subfolders within.
* Input the how wide do you want the image to be. Typical screen resolutions are 1920, 2560, 3840.
* Select image quality, higher is better quality. Note that the resizer cannot improve the quality of the existing image. However, resizing with a lower image quality will reduce image quality but, will reduce the file size. At 600 dpi and 300 dpi you should not notice a drop in visual quality.
* Confirm resize options and resize. Remember to backup any files as this process cannot be undone. Resizing an image and then changing it back will not result in the original image.
